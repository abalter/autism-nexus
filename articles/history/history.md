# Personal Story: Why I’m doing this
My name is Ariel Balter. I am a 56yo man with a Ph.D. in physics who has contributed to published biomedical research at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) and Providence Portland Medical Center on and off for the last 8 years—when I can keep a job. I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2021 and autism in 2022. This information changed everything about my life, including helping me access tools to finally work closer to my potential. But I was still let go from my most recent job in September of 2023. 

As often happens, autism has become one of my “special interests.” Having immersed myself in the scientific literature on autism, I learned that, unlike any other scientific field I have mastered over the years, discoveries in the last 5 to 10 years have rendered almost everything that came before as essentially wrong. I'm ashamed to admit that I had largely accepted the 'deficit' paradigm of neurodiversity and realized that many assumptions I had made about myself and my autistic son were based on outdated ideas.

I began to participate in the autistic community through Facebook and multiple support groups during the Winter months of 2023-2024. I soon met at least 100 other people in my community with stories similar to mine—all struggling with similar issues in their lives, personal relationships, and work relationships. Many are not as financially privileged as I am and have struggled to get formal evaluations through their Medicaid insurance. Additionally, they yearn for social contact with people they feel comfortable with, such as those they met in spaces like these support groups. Meanwhile, due to the extreme demand, the organizations running the support groups have had to restrict membership or seek out facilitators to start new ones.

The stories I hear in this brave and beautiful tribe of people have inspired me to use my skills and energy to figure out how to better connect members of the autistic community to each other and to the scattered resources that are out there for them, to connect these resources to each other, and to locate and report on missing pieces. I decided that I would try to make doing this my job rather than continuing my frustrating job search.

There is an immense amount of work to do to help prepare the aging autistic adult community and a poorly informed medical system for the fun times they are going to have together in the coming generation or two. Fortunately, there are also numerous skilled, intelligent, creative, compassionate, and hard-working individuals in the autistic community who are ready and capable of undertaking this work. And they are the right people to do it.
