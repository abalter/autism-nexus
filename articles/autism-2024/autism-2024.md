# Autism (and neurodivergence) in 2024

Starting in the early 2010s, autistic adults began describing their own autistic experience as quite different from the prevailing understanding, which has been primarily based on non-autistic observation of children. A small but active cohort of autistic researchers were entering graduate school and soon set up their own research programs. The double empathy hypothesis (Milton, 2012) was repeatedly validated, and the theory of mind deficit hypothesis (Baron-Cohen, 1985) was repeatedly invalidated. Genetic studies and FMR-I imaging showed that autism is purely developmental, highly heritable, and primarily genetic. The prevailing scientific narratives about autism were just wrong. 

This is not a problem for science. This is the process of science functioning as it should. However, for autistic people in the general population, this is a HUGE problem. Because we had mistakenly assumed that we could treat or even prevent autism, we focused almost all of our resources on children with the assumption that if we succeeded in those efforts, we could greatly reduce the impacts for adults. However, the opposite happened. We now know that people are born autistic and will die autistic. And that while autism frequently co-occurs with challenging conditions, whether autism inherently imparts limitations or enhanced abilities varies greatly not only from person to person but from family to family and situation to situation.

This revolution in autism science coincided with the growth of the neurodiversity paradigm and resulted in a number of controversies within the autism community. The term “neurodivergent” does not have a proper scholarly definition, there is a general agreement that it refers to innate aspects of cognition and perception that are based on neurology rather than lived experience. In fact, science has found strong relationships with commonly co-occurring conditions traits, including autism, ADHD, OCD, alexithymia, dyslexia, synesthesia, and certain types of cognitive or learning disabilities.

Image 1: What “spectrum” really means

We have recently learned that some frequently co-occurring conditions, such as OCD, alexithymia, and certain intellectual disabilities, can be diagnosed independently. We have learned that many non-speaking autistic people are actually actually capable of verbal language and can be brilliant writers with assistive technology. We have scientifically confirmed some anecdotes about autistic people in terms of their increased aptitude for problem-solving, pattern matching, cognitive empathy, and certain types of rational and logical thinking. Perhaps most significantly, we have learned through confirmation of the double empathy hypothesis that autistic people lack neither the ability nor the desire to socialize. Instead, autistic and non-autistic people have very different socialization styles, needs, and expectations. All of this is to say that:

Any individual autistic person has a unique combination of traits that may or may not be disabling in certain contexts.
These same traits can be exceptionally enabling, fulfilling, and productive in other contexts.
The very fact of being autistic in a predominantly non-autistic world presents obstacles, inflicts subtle traumas, and is extremely exhausting, even for individuals with few intrinsic limitations.
Autistic children inevitably grow up to be equally autistic adults and later autistic elders.

Consequently, we are just waking up to the fact that somewhere between 1% and 3% of the adult population already consists of an anatomically distinct subgroup that is aging in distinct ways, both physically and in terms of lived experience. Because autism presents as a constellation of traits rather than a linear spectrum of abilities, most autistic adults are able to perform the activities of daily living (ADLs) independently, but often at a great cost to their emotional well-being. The unique challenges we face do not check the boxes in Oregon’s Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (I/DD) assessments. But they are real.

The Oregon Department of Disability Services (ODDS) reported that the agency was serving 22,984 adults with an intellectual or developmental disability in 2023. A 2021-2022 survey by ODDS and along with the National Core Indicators (NCI) project showed that 6,435 (28%) of Oregon adults receiving I/DD services had an Autism diagnosis. The US Census estimates that in 2022 there were roughly 3,404,221 adults (18+) in Oregon. A CDC study (2020) estimated that in 2017, 2.28% (95% CI [1.83, 2.8]) of Oregon adults had Autism; in numbers: 77,616 (95% CI [62,297, 95,318]).

As you can see in Image 2, if even a modest portion of the autistic adults not receiving I/DD services need supports that don't currently exist, that still constitutes a number much larger than those currently receiving I/DD services.
