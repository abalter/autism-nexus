# Budget

Justify hourly rates.
We will continue to flesh out the three-phase plan we described in the executive summary and put the details here.

Because so many skilled and educated AND+ adults are underemployed and unemployed, Dr. Balter has been reluctant to ask others to volunteer. Instead, the Autism Nexus of Oregon will employ only AND+ adults and pay them a market wage. The wages will be at the low end during the initial Seed phase and increase during the later phases. The hourly rates shown represent full compensation on a 1099 and do not include benefits. We will make necessary adjustments when we are able to provide benefits as well.
