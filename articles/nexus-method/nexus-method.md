# The Nexus Approach
This project will combine a long-term strategy with immediate action. There are many things we can do and are doing immediately, such as building relationships, creating information products, and launching The Uncommons. Other goals will take time. Our model works in three steps:

I. Identify the infrastructure
- Build physical community through neurodivergent-friendly social spaces (e.g. coworking) in a naturalistic way: The Uncommons. 
- Gather, curate, and share information from existing resources and organizations, and regularly verify and update this information as needed.

II. Find the cracks:
- Get to know the community and learn about unmet needs. This can happen naturally and informally through The Uncommons, meetings, and surveys.
- Connect people to services that can fill these gaps.
- Determine if unmet needs result from a lack of existing services, stigma or bias, or inaccurate, out-of-date, or missing information.
- Continue searching out and establishing relationships with existing programs and organizations. 

III. Build and repair:
- Report on unmet needs in the community and research solutions.
- Become a local resource for knowledge both for and about the adult autistic and ND community. Autism 411 and 211, so to speak.
- Become a local resource for knowledge about adult autism and ND issuesâ€”social, medical, political, etc.
- Facilitate peer support by creating connections between organizations, between clients and organizations, and between individuals.
