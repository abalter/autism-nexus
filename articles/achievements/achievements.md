# Work Underway
## The Uncommons
Two organizations have offered us temporary use of high-quality common space for coworking and meetings. The space includes internet, printers, computers, meeting areas, lounge areas, and kitchen facilities. This will be the start of The Uncommons.

## Access to Assessments
Finding a provider to do an autism or ADHD evaluation can be hard, even with private insurance. For those on Medicaid, it can be literally impossible. We have been partnering with Health Share Oregon to create two guides. One, for Medicaid members, explains the Community Care Organization (CCO) system and outlines the processes and requirements of different health plans. Another, for Medicaid doctors, explains why it is important for adults to get evaluations and provides information on writing a successful referral.

## Alternate Routes for Assessments
Because some networks are entirely lacking providers at this time, we have communicated I/DD and Vocational Rehab (VR) and created materials to facilitate accessing evaluations through those programs. Using the requirements these programs use to determine if they will directly pay for a client to have an evaluation and laws about Medicaid/Medicare coverage, we created a template Letter of Medical Necessity to reduce the burden on providers less familiar with autism in adults to provide the necessary documentation. A client can have a licensed medical or behavioral practitioner fill out this letter and then present it to I/DD or VR.

## Outreach Consulting and Development
We have begun working with the Autism Society of Oregon to help them refine and improve their online resources, which could turn into a consulting contract.
