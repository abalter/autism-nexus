# Executive Summary
Autistic, ADHD, and other neurodivergent (AND+) adults with lower support needs face a conundrum. Many face unique and often unseen social, employment, mental health, and identity challenges without the benefit of specialized services or even research-backed knowledge about their situations. Research on the unique experiences of adults referred to in the scientific literature as 'autistic without intellectual disabilities' (formerly known as Asperger's syndrome or high-functioning autism) has only recently begun in earnest. 

Consequently, significant gaps in knowledge and services for these individuals are resulting in adverse effects on them, their families, and their communities in terms of physical health, mental health, and economic well-being. The vast majority of AND+ adults are considered too capable to receive assistance from most support systems, despite facing significant challenges that are often dismissed or disbelieved. They simply fall through the cracks—cracks waiting to trap autistic children as they enter adulthood and lose the school-based supports they once relied upon.

The Autism Nexus of Oregon is filling the cracks by strengthening connections within the adult AND+ community and becoming the go-to source of information both for and about the community. We are building connections throughout the AND+ adult community. We are starting AND+ friendly meeting and coworking spaces called The Uncommons, where people can unmask, mingle, and collaborate authentically. We are working with local organizations to create better information for and about AND+ medical needs. We are seeking out programs and organizations that exist but are not widely known about and working to connect these organizations to potential clients and to each other.

So far, this work has been done almost single-handedly by Dr. Ariel Balter, a late-diagnosed autistic Ph.D. scientist during a recent phase of unemployment. He envisions The Autism Nexus of Oregon as an organization that continues and expands on the work he has done so far by employing skilled and educated people like him who are also under- or unemployed. We have already received substantial support from the community in terms of in-kind resources. 

We plan to build out our capability in three phases through funding and continued in-kind donations, with a low emphasis on volunteer work. Dr. Balter strongly believes that the Autism Nexus of Oregon should be staffed by AND+ people earning a market wage. Our current model includes 20% overhead for our parent organization Autism Research and Resources of Oregon (ARRO), as a placeholder. We are working with them to determine the number.

# Organizational Background
When I started attending support groups for autistic adults in my community in late 2023, I was stunned by thelevel of unmet needs. I was able to confirm that many Oregon Medicaid recipients do not have a single provider in-network to do autism evaluations. I have personally gotten to know many autistic adults who are struggling despiteneeding little or nothing in the way of traditional support services. They fully manage the ADLs but may need helpwith things such as employment, housing, navigating bureaucratic requirements, accessing appropriate, autism-informed medical care, adjusting to their new diagnoses, or simply getting an evaluation. We are filling these gapsby collaborating with local organizations to improve information both for and about autistic adults' medical andsocial needs, strengthening connections within the adult autistic community, and connecting existing programs andorganizations to potential clients and each other.

# Program Description
Significant research on the experiences of autistic adults is only just starting and the existing gaps in knowledgeand services for this community are resulting in significant adverse effects to physical health, mental health, andeconomic well-being. Examples include reduced income, reduced productivity, and reduced life expectancy. Thenegative effects on intersectional people are larger. Despite facing significant challenges, the vast majority ofautistic adults are considered too capable to receive assistance from most support systems and simply fall throughthe cracks—cracks waiting to trap autistic children as they enter adulthood and lose the child-focused school- andcommunity-based supports they once relied upon.
With a combination of long-term strategy and immediate action, we are filling the cracks by strengtheningconnections within the adult autistic community and becoming the go-to source of information both for and aboutthe community. Contrary to popular stereotypes, autistic people want to socialize, but are more comfortable withother autistic people. We are starting autistic-friendly meeting/coworking spaces called “The Uncommons”, wherepeople can unmask, mingle, and collaborate authentically. We are working with local organizations to create betterinformation for and about autistics’ medical needs. We are working to connect existing organizations to potentialclients and to each other.
Our model works in three steps, starting with community:

I. Identify the infrastructure
* Bring the community together physically and virtually.
* Listen to their stories.
* Build trust.

II. Find the cracks:
* Learn about their unmet needs.
* Identify the causes.

III. Build and repair:
* Report on unmet needs and research solutions.
* Become a local resource for knowledge both for and about the adult AND+ community.
* Find solutions and facilitate implementation.

We plan to build out our capability in three phases staffed by AND+ people earning a market wage.

## Phase 1: Sprout (Weeks 1-8, budget $30,240)
- Continue ongoing work:
  * Build community and connections through The Uncommons
  * Create informational materials on evaluations
  * Build relationships, find partnerships, solicit contracts
- Define our capabilities
- Identify large funding opportunities

## Phase 2: Grow (Weeks 9-26, budget: $120,960)
- Continue ongoing work
- Market and expand The Uncommons
- Apply for large grants and contracts
- Build our information infrastructure
  * Databases
  * Expertise
- Build our communication infrastructure
  * Information products
  * Podcasts, talks, lectures

## Phase 3: Thrive (Weeks 26-52, budget: TBD)
- Change the world

## How is this program innovative
The Autism Nexus is innovative in that we are working from within the autistic community to discover what peopleneed, validating these needs through evidence, and working with the existing infrastructure to meet the needs.Many resources exist to support these needs, and yet autistic adults are often unaware of them, and supportorganizations are often unaware of each other. This program will support unmet needs, and allow existing supportsto be accessed more effectively. Most importantly, it all starts by building community.

## Provide us your top two intended goals or outcomes for this project
- Create information products that will help autistic adults learn about and use existing services they have beenunable to find or have struggled to access.
- Improve existing systems of care through evidence-based information that will increase awareness andunderstanding about the unmet needs of autistic adults.

 I'm a recently diagnosed autistic adult, and I am starting a nonprofit organization to support other autistic adults in Oregon. The goals are to 1) build community through autism-friendly physical spaces, 2) determine unmet needs in the community, and 3) find ways to meet those needs.

3) Will primarily focus on using information to improve what existing systems of support know about the adult autistic community, connect people to services, and connect organizations to each other. One key example is to increase access to evaluations and autism-aware medical providers. Another is to work with healthcare organizations so they better understand the needs of autistic adult clients. 

I'm starting a nonprofit organization to support autistic adults in Oregon. It's going to be called The Autism and Neurodiversity Nexus of Oregon. Or some combination of those words. Maybe Oregon Nexus for Autism.
I have a business plan and am working with [ARRO](https://arroautism.org] to be my umbrella. I'm starting to apply for funding and have a number of people helping out. The goals are to

1. build community through autism-friendly physical spaces
2. determine unmet needs in the community, and
3. find ways to meet those needs.

 This has resulted in poor outreach, 
- Information gaps result in missing services. Example: Some Oregon healthcare networks don't consider autism evaluations as "medically necessary" for adults even though we know that autistic people have distinct physiology throughout their body.
- Cognitive differences, sensority differences, and communication differences impede optimal exchange of information between autistic patients and their doctors. Doctors poorly informed about how to care for autistic people. Example: how to ask about pain.
- Poor exhange of information between support and service organizations and autistic voices in the community results in disconnects between organizations and their intended clients. 
- There is a general lack of knowledge about and coordination between organizations and services that support autistic adults.

Autistic people experience the world differently, process their experiences differently, think about the world differently, and communicate differently. These are issues of information.

The equivalent to a sidewalk ramp or brail on an elevator would be a device that translates ideas and emotions and experiences between autistic and non-autistic people. Many autistic people report using chat AIs to translate their autistic style emails into ones that will be palatable to their non-autistic cow-workers.
