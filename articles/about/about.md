# Executive Summary
Autistic, ADHD, and other neurodivergent (AND+) adults with lower support needs face a conundrum. Many face unique and often unseen social, employment, mental health, and identity challenges without the benefit of specialized services or even research-backed knowledge about their situations. Research on the unique experiences of adults referred to in the scientific literature as 'autistic without intellectual disabilities' (formerly known as Asperger's syndrome or high-functioning autism) has only recently begun in earnest. 

Consequently, significant gaps in knowledge and services for these individuals are resulting in adverse effects on them, their families, and their communities in terms of physical health, mental health, and economic well-being. The vast majority of AND+ adults are considered too capable to receive assistance from most support systems, despite facing significant challenges that are often dismissed or disbelieved. They simply fall through the cracksâ€”cracks waiting to trap autistic children as they enter adulthood and lose the school-based supports they once relied upon.

The Autism Nexus of Oregon is filling the cracks by strengthening connections within the adult AND+ community and becoming the go-to source of information both for and about the community. We are building connections throughout the AND+ adult community. We are starting AND+ friendly meeting and coworking spaces called The Uncommons, where people can unmask, mingle, and collaborate authentically. We are working with local organizations to create better information for and about AND+ medical needs. We are seeking out programs and organizations that exist but are not widely known about and working to connect these organizations to potential clients and to each other.

So far, this work has been done almost single-handedly by Dr. Ariel Balter, a late-diagnosed autistic Ph.D. scientist during a recent phase of unemployment. He envisions The Autism Nexus of Oregon as an organization that continues and expands on the work he has done so far by employing skilled and educated people like him who are also under- or unemployed. We have already received substantial support from the community in terms of in-kind resources. 

We plan to build out our capability in three phases through funding and continued in-kind donations, with a low emphasis on volunteer work. Dr. Balter strongly believes that the Autism Nexus of Oregon should be staffed by AND+ people earning a market wage. Our current model includes 20% overhead for our parent organization Autism Research and Resources of Oregon (ARRO), as a placeholder. We are working with them to determine the number.
