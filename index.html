            <summary>Autistic adults are struggling in huge nubmers</summary>
            Autistic adults are effectively marginalized and underserved due to being largely overlooked. Here are some
            reasons:
            - Autistic people are born autistic and die autistic. So, there are vastly more autistic adults (18+) than
            autistic
            chilren.
            - We offer lots of public services and supports to children, but very few to adults.
            - We know far less about the lives of autistic adults than we do autistic children.
            Consequently, statistics show that autistic adults experience devastating rates of mental and physical
            health issues
            (e.g. suicide and life expectancy) and enormous rates of uder-/unemployment.

            <summary>What do they need?</summary>
            The vast majority of autistic people are physically, cognitively, intellectually, and emotionally, capable.
            So they
            don't qualify for disability services which require demonstrating innate physical, cognitive, emotional
            limitations.

            In numbers:
            - Oregon I/DD serves ~6,500 adults with an autism diagnosis.
            - There is likely to be anywhere from 15 to 25 times that many autistic adults in Oregon.

            Here are some things they want and can't get:
            - The general public knowing what autism really is and really isn't
            - Autism-friendly spaces to socialize and build community
            - Access to evaluations
            - Proper care from doctors
            - Acknowledgement of unconscious bias
            - Effort from non-autistic people to overcome the "double empathy" problem
            - True accommodations at work, school, and other situations
            - True equity and inclusion at work, school and in other situations
            - Support for their poorly-understood and sometimes intermittent needs around:
            - Communication
            - Sensory input
            - Social expectations
            - Cognitive style
            - Work style

            <summary>The Autism Nexus</summary>
            The autism nexus supports autistic adults in Oregon. This is how we work:

            1. Build community through outreach and autism-friendly physical spaces.
            2. Determine unmet needs in the community.
            3. Find ways to meet those needs.

            The stereotype of autistic people being non-social, anti-social, introverted, etc. is false. Due to the
            double
            empathy problem, social relationshiops can be hard between autistic and not-autistic people. Autistic adults
            often
            realize that they enjoy socializing with other autistic people.

            By building community for autistic adults we can work from within. We will listen to autistic voices and
            identify
            and document the root-causes of systemic challenges. We will then gather data which we will reprocess into
            accurate,
            evidence-based information products.

            These information products will fill unment needs.

            <summary>Community is Key</summary>
            The most positive force for change for autistic people has been the growth in leadership by autistic voices.
            With
            our past focus on autistic children, parents have been the leaders. Other allies have provided immense
            support.

            However, no one understands autistic people like other autistic people. Fact.

            The Autism Nexus will help build connections within Oregon's adult autistic community, between the community
            and
            organizations that support it, and between those organizations.

            <summary>Information is the Answer</summary>
            The challenges autistic people face are mainly around information.

            - Little is known about the adult autistic community due to lack of research. Medical systems don't regard
            autism as
            a physical condition and don't support autistic sensory and communication differences.
            - Systems of support are not set up for autistic adults. Misconceptions about autism make organizations
            confused
            about why an articulate adult is asking for disability services. Websites are not autism-friendly and intake
            forms
            don't have the right boxes to check.
            - Organizations that support autistic adults are poorly connected to the community and each other.

            The Autism Nexus will a go-to source for information both for and about the autistic adult community in
            Oregon.
            Information we curate, analyze, and publish will
            - help autistic adults learn about and use existing services they have beenunable to find or have struggled
            to
            access.
            - increase awareness and understanding about the unmet needs of autistic adults and improve existing systems
            of care
